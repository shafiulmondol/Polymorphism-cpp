## Introduction

Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. This enables flexibility and scalability in code by allowing functions and methods to work with objects of different types through a unified interface.

This repository provides examples and documentation on:

- Compile-time polymorphism (function overloading and operator overloading).
- Run-time polymorphism (virtual functions and inheritance).
- Best practices for implementing polymorphism in C++.

## Features

- **Examples:** Comprehensive examples demonstrating both compile-time and run-time polymorphism.
- **Explanations:** Detailed documentation to help understand the concepts.
- **Best Practices:** Guidance on implementing polymorphism effectively.

## Prerequisites

To work with the code in this repository, you need:

- A basic understanding of C++.
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts.
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shafiulmondol/Polymorphism-cpp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Polymorphism-cpp
   ```

3. Compile the examples:

   ```bash
   g++ -o example examples/example1.cpp
   ```

## Usage

1. Explore the examples directory to find specific use cases.
2. Run compiled examples to see how polymorphism works in practice:

   ```bash
   ./example
   ```

3. Modify the examples or create your own programs to experiment further.

## Examples

The repository includes examples such as:

- **Function Overloading:** Using the same function name with different parameter types.
- **Operator Overloading:** Customizing operators for user-defined types.
- **Virtual Functions:** Implementing dynamic method dispatch.
- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces:** Creating reusable and extensible designs.
