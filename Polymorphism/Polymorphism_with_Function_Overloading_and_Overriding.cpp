/*Explain the difference between function overloading and function overriding in C++. 
Provide examples to demonstrate both concepts in a program. Include the following:

Use function overloading for multiple display() functions in a class Printer.
Use function overriding with a base class Printer and derived classes InkjetPrinter 
and LaserPrinter, implementing a virtual print() function.*/
